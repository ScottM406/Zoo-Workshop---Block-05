      <p>There are several species of bears. They vary greatly in size and color. Their diets range a bit, but they all love eating animal flesh and trash.
       <br> It is important to remember that if a bear is chasing you, you must at <i>least</i> run faster than the slowest person in your group.</p>

      <p>Giraffes love to eat leaves, which is good, because they are built like leaf-eating machines... and in the wild, they are not able to eat lettuce out of peoples' hands.
       <br> Some think they look very silly, but we at Wild Animal Mini-Zoo find them to be adorable.</p>

      <p>They say that lions are the kings of the jungle. <b>THIS IS FALSE.</b> They are the kings of the savannah. Also, the queens of the savannah.
       <br> The males are actually very lazy (with the exception of the male cast of the lion king).</p>

      <p>Some monkeys have funny haircuts and some monkeys have funny butts, but all monkeys do funny things.
        <br>Monkeys aren't as likely as their great ape cousins to throw feces at zoogoers, but it is still a liability, so zookeepers should be vigilant.</p>

      <p>Alligators' natural habitats are golf courses and suburban neighborhoods in the Southern United States, but they have now spread into the wild!
        <br>My Mama says that alligators are ornery because they got all them teeth and no toothbrush.</p>
